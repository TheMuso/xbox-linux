config FATX_FS
	tristate "FATX fs support"
	help
	  This allows you to mount MSDOS partitions of your hard drive (unless
	  they are compressed; to access compressed MSDOS partitions under
	  Linux, you can either use the DOS emulator DOSEMU, described in the
	  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, or try dmsdosfs in
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/>. If you
	  intend to use dosemu with a non-compressed MSDOS partition, say Y
	  here) and MSDOS floppies. This means that file access becomes
	  transparent, i.e. the MSDOS files look and behave just like all
	  other Unix files.

	  If you have Windows 95 or Windows NT installed on your MSDOS
	  partitions, you should use the VFAT file system (say Y to "VFAT fs
	  support" below), or you will not be able to see the long filenames
	  generated by Windows 95 / Windows NT.

	  This option will enlarge your kernel by about 7 KB. If unsure,
	  answer Y. This will only work if you said Y to "DOS FAT fs support"
	  as well. To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called msdos.

config FATX_CODEPAGE
	int "Default codepage for FATX"
	depends on FATX_FS
	default 437
	help
	  This option should be set to the codepage of your FAT filesystems.
	  It can be overridden with the "codepage" mount option.
	  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/vfat.txt> for more information.
